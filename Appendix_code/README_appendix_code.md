This directory contains analyses and figures used for appendix A (aquaplanet simulations vs. ERA5) and BCD (different nudging experiments) with the following files:

(1) Paper4_figure6_appendixA_vsERA5.ipynb: 

Calculate and plot the corresponding KW composite using ERA5 data, and compare with aquaplanet simulation results in the main figures

(2) Paper4_appendixBCD_all-nudging-exp.ipynb: 

Calculate and plot KW diagnostic in nudging experiments (plot all experiments together)

(3) Check_KW-individual-nudging-exp.ipynb: 

This is the analysis code for KWs in individual nudging experiment. This code generates data used for plotting. This is the prerequisite for (2) Paper4_appendixBCD_all-nudging-exp.ipynb.
